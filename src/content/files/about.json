      "bio": [
        "James Bellile grew up in Wisconsin and left to join the Army, as a logistical officer, after finishing college in 2001. 90 days later, 9-11 changed the world and, after completing his four years of honorable service on Active Duty, James moved to Las Vegas to start a civilian life in 2005. In the Army, among many things, James learned the officer’s code LDRSHIP, which stands for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity and Personal Courage. He is one of those rare humans still left out there where you can still agree on terms, shake hands, and he’ll never under deliver. He is the respected real estate broker, founder and operator of Modern Times Realty, which is based out of Las Vegas, Nevada, and has been an entrepreneur for over a decade and half.",
        "In real estate, James first became interested in the cannabis industry while trading stocks and, after studying the publically traded companies, noticed some anomalies in the national economy. He then decided to specialize in the cannabis sector for his local commercial real estate clients. James has also always been interested in incorporating green energy into real estate and industrial hemp is one future material he’d like to use consistently in homes. He sees a nearly unlimited potential for the uses of cannabis and is very excited to be at the forefront of a time in our nation’s history when falsely demonized plants will rise from the ashes to create a shift in the global economy by disrupting many inefficient and outdated industries. Furthermore, having been an athlete for many years prior to his military service, sustaining many injuries, which required multiple surgeries, and witnessing, first hand, the often outright dangerous policies and procedures of the Veteran’s Administration medical facilities, James is personally passionate about seeing cannabis used as one more natural healing remedy that is accessible to all people.",
        "Commercial Cannabis Inc is his brainchild after the COVID-19 pandemic placed the world on its ear and gave him a new direction to focus. He noticed along his real estate journey that, although the cannabis industry is very large, by and large it is a very unorganized group of two polarities, either people only concerned about making money or people who truly love cannabis and are passionate about their products, but unable to join the business world enough to do much more than struggle with their business ventures. James thoroughly believes that the potentially massive cannabis industry will soon spread like wildfire. He intends to find those business owners, who are as passionate as he is about the good of cannabis, and introduce them to one another so they can supply the world, while, simultaneously, putting the people concerned with just making money, out of business.",
        "A wise person once told James, “People will forget what you say, they will forget what you do, but they will NEVER forget how you made them feel.” The folks at Commercial Cannabis Inc intend to prove that we are different in the sense that you, our valued customers and, hopefully, eventual friends, will always enjoy doing business with us and never ever have to question that we are truly trying to do the right thing and intend on bringing about a little better world, while making an honest living. We hope to meet you soon."
